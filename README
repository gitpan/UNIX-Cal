UNIX::Cal

This package is a perl/Inline implementation of the UNIX cal 
command line tool.

It is really paying homage to the original code from
   The Regents of the University of California
   and
   Berkeley by Kim Letkeman.


To build you first need to install Inline ( and Inline::C ),
and the do the usual:

perl Makefile.PL
make 
make test
make install
